### ISLES 2015 data for the example

In order to run the example, along with the source code of the CRF we include a number of NIFTI files in the subdirectory: ./applicationAndExamples/example.
They are modified versions of data from the training set of the SISS Ischemic Stroke Lesion Challenge 2015 (http://www.isles-challenge.org/ISLES2015/).
They were downloaded from: https://www.virtualskeleton.ch/ISLES/Start2015.

In comparison to the originals, the files provided here were modified with intensity normalisation and renaming.
